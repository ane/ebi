Entity—Boundary—Interactor
==========================

.. rubric:: A modern application architecture

This repository contains implementation examples of the
**Entity—Boundary—Interactor** (**EBI**) application architecture as
presented by Uncle Bob in his series of talks titled `Architecture: The
Lost Years <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhNIttd87xs>`__ and `his
book <http://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8>`__.

The EBI architecture is a modern application architecture suited for a
wide range of application styles. It is especially suitable for web
application APIS, but the idea of EBI is to produce an implementation
agnostic architecture, it is not tied to a specific platform,
application, language or framework. It is a way to design programs, not
a library.

The name **Entity–Boundary—Interactor** originates from `a master's
thesis <https://jyx.jyu.fi/dspace/bitstream/handle/123456789/41024/URN:NBN:fi:jyu-201303071297.pdf?sequence=1>`__
where this architecture is studied in depth. Names that are common or
synonymous are **EBC** where *C* stands for **Controller**.

Examples of how to implement the architecture are given in this document
and are written in Elixir.
